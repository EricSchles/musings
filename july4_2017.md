# True Love

What does it mean for a love to be true?  Does it mean they always tell you the truth?  Does it mean they stay till you die? 
Does it mean you are happy with that person?  What about if they give you money?  Security?  A family?

I don't know if there is a measurement that exists for true love.  Perhaps a set of measures would suffice?  But how many do
you need?  What would they be?  Would it be measured in how the people feel about one another?  If so, how do you measure that?
In actions?  In chemical responses?  In dialation of the pupils?  

Love is a drug.  Of this I am certain.  Because it is a drug I was afflicted by.  It's something I felt when I was near someone
specific.  It changed how I behaved.  It changed what I thought.  It changed how I approached the world.  It altered by entire
perception and how strongly I felt things.  

The way I describe love, is like a blanket.  It is a cornerstone, an anchor.  It is a safety net.  Perhaps when it's true, the
net doesn't break, no matter what.  Perhaps when love is true it holds, no matter what.

So then a natural question comes forth, what does it mean for a love to be real, but not true?  Or when people speak of love, 
does true love mean real love?  I don't think the two are the same.  Because I think you can love someone, for a moment.  I 
think true love, necessarily means real love.  But real love, does not necessarily mean true love.  

This all comes down to societal convention, the stories we tell of love and deep interpersonal relationship.  I believe love to
be a part of the human story.  An important, deep part of our history.  What can you tell from a culture, a people, by the way
they love?  What can't you tell?

To me, I think, the way a people love, says a lot.  It speaks of the capacity for empathy, the station of the genders, the 
customs of the culture, and perhaps the heart of the society.  Is it not true, that a society stems from those who continue it
going into the next generation?  Perhaps in some places, love is not the driving force for reproducing.  But that too speaks
volumes of how a people are.  It speaks of their capacity for empathy, I think.  

It also seems, that a society may define it's economy via love, depending.  Most people do date, do seek companionship.  Perhaps,
they don't find it really.  But I think most do.  There does not appear to be anything special about finding someone to be with.
At least not in the societal sense.  We find others.  Because humans don't want to be alone.  This seems clear to me as well.

So now that we have set some rules and some assertions, let us better understand this thing called love, via measurement.
And let us see, if maybe, we can define the measures of true and real love.  Before we measure, we must define what we mean.

I define real love as love that exists and is felt between two people.
I define true love as real love that endures.

So the first question is how to measure real love, here I set out some measures that I think will do an adaquate job:

* A chemical response in both parties.  I know from the last time I was inlove, that I felt a strong biological reaction in me.
I feel as though the way I perceived reality changed.  I was more emotionally open.  And I could better internalize emotional
feelings.  I felt things more strongly.  I believe this was a neurological reaction due to chemical release in the brain.
I believe my partner felt some of this as well.

* An avoidance of the opposite sex.  When I was in the relationship, I was less interested in members of the opposite sex.  I 
had friends and developed some friendships with women.  But they were less interesting to me, because I didn't see them as a
potential mate.  

* A greater adversity to risk.  Having a partner means needing to be stable.  The stability that goes along with wanting to make 
sure the other persons life is stable.

* Tending towards normalcy.  I did more typical things in my last relationship.  Instead of trying new things, or doing something
more intense.  I tended towards normal things, like watching movies or going to local watering holes.  The mundane is more likely
a part of life, in a relationship.  I watched more tv and spent more time on the couch.

* A change in purchasing behavior.  I spent more money on food and clothing than on toys in the relationship.  The essentials are
all I needed, because my partner filled the void.

* Any new roles I considered professionally had to be a true gain in dollars.  I refused any start ups or things that would pay me
less, regardless of how interesting the opportunity.  Money and stability becomes a utility maximizing function, instead of
how interesting the work is.  This led to overall, less job satisfaction.

* More frequent doctors visits.  My significant other would push me to go to the doctor, whenever I got sick, regardless of the
issue.  Something I likely wouldn't do for myself, except in the case of a broken bone.

This is probably not an exhaustive list, but it gives us a good start.

Now let's define the measures of a love that is true.

These are merely rolling averages above the measures.  If the above behavior persists throughout the relationship, then I think
you can claim the love is true.
